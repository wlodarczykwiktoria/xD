testy
Students are connected to the teacher with pipes. Students write to a teacher using one pipe shared between all students. The teacher writes to the students using individual pipe links. The teacher checks the presence list. They write a message to each student on the list and to the standard output: Teacher: Is [PID] here?, to which student responds Student [PID]: HERE both using the shared pipe and to the standard output. After the presence check, everyone exits.
